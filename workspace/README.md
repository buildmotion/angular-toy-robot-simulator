# Robot Simulator (Angular)

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). One of the main goals is to separate the different concerns of the application into different libraries. This way, the application is more modular and easier to maintain.

This had the following libraries:

- `@buildmotion/robot-toy-componets`: This library contains the UI components.
- `@buildmotion/toy-robot-service`: This library contains the services that interact with the robot - providing the business logic. This library is also responsible for the state management of the robot. It does not contain any UI elements or concerns.

## Getting Started

- Need to install and use Node.js version 20.12.2 or higher.
  - this workspace is using NVM to manage the Node.js version.
  - `nvm ls` # list the installed versions of Node.js
  - `nvm use 20.12.2`
- The package manager is Yarn.
  - `npm install -g yarn`
- Install the dependencies.
  - `yarn`

## Running the Application

- Run the application. The following script will build and serve the application.
  - `yarn serve:ui`
- Launch the application - use the Run and Debug launch command (F5) in Visual Studio Code.

## Testing the Workspace

- Run the tests.
  - `yarn test:all`: will run all of the tests in the workspace for each project. You can view the results in the `.coverage` folder.

## Setup and Configuration

The Nx CLI was used to create the application and library projects. 

> See: [Setup](./docs/setup.md).

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

### Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Genenerate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
